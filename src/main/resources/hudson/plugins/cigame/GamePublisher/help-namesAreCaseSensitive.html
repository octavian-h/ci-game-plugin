        The checkbox decides if the game should treat the user names in Jenkins case sensitive or not.
        Jenkins treats user names as case sensitive, which mean that user "John" is not the same user as "john".
        Some SCMs make it possible to login with the same user but with different casing,
        which means that to Jenkins there are separate users.
        This introduces a problem in the game as one real user can have several Jenkins users.

        If this checkbox is enabled, the game will treat all users as separate, just like Jenkins does.
        If this checkbox is disabled, the game will make case insensitive look ups of the user names
        which mean points awarded to "John" and "john" will be awarded to the same user.
